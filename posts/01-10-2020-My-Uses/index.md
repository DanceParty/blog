# Software

#### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/jkd65?si=2XfaiGZ8Rq67x7_AG9U9og)

This is what I use to listen to all of my music on a day-to-day basis. Check out my profile in the above link.

#### [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/user/keevandance)

I use LastFM to track my listening habits. Here and there it is fun to go back and look at how much and to what I am listening to throughout the years. I have this integrated with Spotify to track my plays there.

#### Notion

Notion is my everything note taker. I jot down ideas, work related things, music, blogs, etc... For studying and memorizing though (mostly Korean), I will generally write to paper and then organize before I put into notion.

#### Firefox

Recently, I have started to use Firefox as my personal primary browser. I develop my personal projects using Firefox and use it for my everyday needs as well.

#### LastPass

My primary password manager for _everything_.

#### Slash

I have recently tried out this program to help me stay focused during work. I can quickly break up ideas and problems into smaller versions and conquer my work one step at a time while staying focused.

#### Battery Stats for Airpods

Love this macOS extension. I use it everyday just to simply check battery and to quickly connect my airpods to my work laptop.

#### Discord

My primary communication with my friends. Mostly gaming friends.

#### KakaoTalk & iMessage

These chat apps are what I use to keep in touch with my immediate family.

#### f.lux

This application is great for reducing eye strain at night. However, one downside is designing things at night only to wake up in the morning realizing you were picking colors that are completely different than what you expect...

#### Streamlabs OBS

I use this application for my minimal streaming that I do either on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/notkeevan) or [mixer](https://mixer.com/animekeev).

#### You Need a Budget

I love this software. Helps me keep tabs on what I am spending money on and allows me to budget with relative ease. Really flexible if you are super into checking your budgeting all of the time or if you are really passive about it.

# Gaming

#### [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/erhiot/)

My main gaming client to store almost all of the games I own. I am mostly playing Rocket League, Halo MCC (w/ Mouse & Keybaord), or Jump King.

#### Battlenet (FrostyFeet#1961)

Starcraft II is my pride and joy. I have been playing this game pretty consistantly (with an occasional break) for the last 10 years. You can check some guides/blogs I have written [here](https://medium.com/keevan-dance-starcraft). Or you can follow my accounts MMR progress [here](https://www.rankedftw.com/team/315404/#td=world&ty=c&ra=best&tyz=0&tx=a&tl=1)

# Programming

#### VSCode

I love this, during college I used a mix of IDEs and other editors, but after graduating and finding VSCode, I try to stay here as much as possible. Here are my [settings and extensions](https://gist.github.com/DanceParty/ae9954580085fa3c69c805caa8751891)

#### Cmder

I feel like this is as close as I have gotten to having the feeling of a terminal similar to macOS but on Windows. It does take some customization, but I highly recomend for other Windows users out there.

#### iterm2 w/ OH MY ZSH

Here is my [config](https://gist.github.com/DanceParty/b1b97e683f20231857442187f0abab32).

#### TablePlus

While I don't feel like I am completely satified with this client, I feel like this is the best client I have found for accessing my databases throughout a couple of my personal projects.

#### Postman

Postman has been my primary HTTP Request client since post-college. I have heard of some other good ones as well, so maybe I'll give those a try someday.

#### Figma

For someone who is _not_ a designer, I feel like Figma helps me make the best mockups or designs that I am capable making with my limited skill set.

#### Netlify

For all projects these days, I try to host them on Netlify because of how freaking easy it is to get setup! Cannot recommend enough...

#### Heroku

I haven't dived into other options too much, but I have found Heroku to be pretty quick and easy for hosting servers and quickly spinning up hosted databases for me.

# Hardware

#### 2018 Macbook Pro (15 inch)

This is not mine, but instead owned by my work. If they did not provide one, I would definitely have my own because I think there is no better laptop than a Macbook (aside from the various complaints that are hopefully fixed in the new version üòÖ).

#### Home Desktop

My desktop that I use for my personal projects and gaming is setup with an Intel i7-7700K (@4.20 GHz), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, and 16 GB RAM. I don't know too much about the details of those specs, just built it a couple years back and now checked the "About my PC" page.

#### iPhone 7+

This is my first iPhone. After my dad passed away, since he has just bought this phone, I felt like I would give it a shot. It has not let me down and will probably continue to use the iPhone.

#### Keyboard - [Leopold FC750R Red Edition](https://i.redd.it/qu5zu16whnp01.jpg)

That isn't my picture but instead the same keyboard. I love this keybaord and probably wont be getting a new one for a long time. I bought this on a trip to Korea about 1.5 years ago.

#### Zowie FK2 Mouse

I was really interested in buying on of the famous [ZOWIE Mico Mice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zowie-MICO-Mouse-Mac-Ways/dp/B00518C8CY) but they seem to be discontinued. These mice are extremely popular in the Starcraft community. This mouse seemed like a solid alternative.

#### 1x Dell Monitor S2417DG 24 inch

I bought a monitor stand for this monitor as well and it seems to be holding up. I really like the size and the small bezels look pretty nice as well üëç.

#### Audio Technica ATH-A990Z

I love these headphones and the sound is incredible. The only complaint I would have is that they are pretty large and rather heavy so it can weigh on your neck overtime.

#### Antlion ModMic USB

Attached to the above headphones is this microphone. Haven't had it very long and it was a recommendation from a friend because they said my old mic sounded like I was underwater, but so far so good.

#### Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 (older version)

This webcam seems to work well for my minimal usages. No complaints here.
